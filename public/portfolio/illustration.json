  "description": "<p>While I've always loved drawing, it became secondary as I focused on my career and learning to code—researching and learning new languages and techniques—occupied my free time. I dabbled with drawing here and there throughout, but the atmosphere in 2020 reignited a passion to draw.</p><p>While pencil and paper is my old reliable, it’s been very exciting to play with new applications and tools and translate those skills to the Apple Pencil and iPad. My style is still shifting and growing, but is always rooted in an emphasis on detail.</p>",
