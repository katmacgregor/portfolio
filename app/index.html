    <p>I made my debut as an artist with "Thanksgiving is Yummy" (Crayola on loose leaf 8.5" by 11"), featured in the kindergarten parent newsletter. This marked the dawn of my creative exploits, which evenutally lead to receiving my BA in Painting and Design from USC's Roski School of Fine Arts.</p>
    <p>My career hopped in a natural progression from design into UI &amp; UX, and into my current position in web development as a Sr. Web Application Developer at Disney Interactive.</p>
    <p>As a developer, I translate my passion for art and design into clean, responsive code. Daily languages include Javascript, Ruby, HTML, CSS, and libraries including Backbone, Underscore, Nunjucks, and Sass.</p>
    <p> When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me doting on my pet rabbit, or at the Three Broomsticks.</p>
