      <p>Tablet-targeted responsive redesign of DisneyJunior.com</p>
      <p>IA, UX, and front-end development</p>
      <p>Targeted user interaction, such as large hit areas, simplified navigation, iconography for non-readers, and continuous swiping to browse content</p>
      <p>Designed and coded background to reflect the current time of day with corresponding animations: morning, afternoon, evening, night, and midnight. During 'day', the clouds would float across the sky, and clicking on the clouds had an easter egg of an animated rainbow, while 'night' had a sleeping moon and shooting stars.</p>
      <p>Designed flexible <a href=\"images/junior/DisneyJunior_Grid.pdf\" target=\"blank\"><i class=\"fa fa-file-pdf-o fa-inline\"></i> Custom Grid System</a> that powers the majority of the site</p>
