      <p>Content can be \“light side,” “dark side,”\ or appear both places. Schema options are added to sort modules as \“Light Side,” “Dark Side,”\ or the default of \“Neutral”\ where the content will appear regardless of which side is selected. Only light/neutral content appears on Light Side/Resistance while dark/neutral content appears on Dark Side/First Order. The selected side is then set in session storage so that the user’s selected is maintained for the length of a single browser tab being open.</p>
