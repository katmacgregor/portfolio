      <p>Overlay takeover for release of The Force Awakens, featuring an overlay to choose between the light and dark sides, which then toggles styling &amp content to reflect which side was chosen.</p>
      <p>Programmed content can be configured to appear on the \“light side,” “dark side,”\ or the default of \“Neutral”\ where the content will appear regardless of which side is selected.</p>
      <p>Users can also toggle their selection after the initial overlay state, which swaps the entire page theming and select content</p>
